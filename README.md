# Hello-World
second excercise 
Hello, my name is Galal and I like to spend most of the time doing something at computer screen 
I am see that in very soon future the computer will change many thing especially in the coding 
the AI  will change and will controle all of our normal life if we do not put the rules to organise the way of using AI 
Today the world has been like one village because of TECNOLOGY and everyday new things come up even we can not use to it 
And I extremly like to use TEC more than anything the ideas I am thinking is horrible
